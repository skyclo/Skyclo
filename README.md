<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>I am Bryce Daly (aka. Skyclo), a self-taught high school student with nearly 8 years of programming experience. I currently am fluent in multiple languages such as JavaScript (DOM, Node.js, and other variants), Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I have experience in several others including PHP, C#, and UE4 Blueprints.</p>

<p>I hope to eventually become fluent in Go, UE4 Blueprints, and C++ or some other language. I also do graphic design work and video editing, among other things. I plan to study Computer Science in college and work on JavaScript full stack software.</p>

<p>When I am not programming, you can often find me playing soccer, playing some of my favorite games or finding new projects to work on!</p>

- 🚀 What I Am Working On: [Ideoaxn](https://github.com/ideoxan), My Personal Website, and of course improving my coding skills 😉
- 🌱 What I Am Learning: Full Stack JS Development, React, and ML
- ⚡ Fun Fact: I started programming at the age of 8!
